# This script sends email reminders to event attendees using SendGrid API.
# Note: SendGrid has a free tier limitation of 100 emails per day.
# If you need to send more emails, consider upgrading to a paid plan or using a different email service.
# The script reads attendee information from Firestore and sends personalized reminders
# with event details, parking information, and a link to the check-in/voting portal.
